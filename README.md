To submit an ArchivesSpace project request: FILL IN LINK TO FORM HERE

This repository is for Smithsonian ArchivesSpace users to submit ArchivesSpace requests for the CAAS team to complete. It is designed to replace the existing project request form, which was a Word document completed by the user and emailed to the CAAS team for review and prioritization. With GitHub, a user will fill out a request form from this repository, an issue will be generated once the form is submitted, and the issue will then be sent to the CAAS team project board for review, prioritization, and assignment. The types of requests include:

- Data export
- Data ingest
- Data migration from existing database
- Feature/plugin request
- Metadata cleanup/modification
- Report (metadata report or similar)
- SOVA Issue
- Other

After receiving, reviewing, and assigning a request, the CAAS team will update the issue with comments and reach out to the requester as needed. Once the request is completed, the issue will be closed and the requester notified.
